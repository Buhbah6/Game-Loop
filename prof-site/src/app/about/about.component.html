            My name's Anthony (Tuna), and I'm a computer science educator at the high school level. My greatest passion in life is playing, developing, and teaching others about video games.
          </p>
          <p class="mission-description">
            I decided I wanted to share my analysis and insights on game development, and any resources that have been useful for me. This includes everything from reviews on new games, coding tutorials, game design principles, and more, all aimed at helping others navigate the complex world of game development.

          <p class="story-description">
            Like many others, I've been playing games far longer than I've been making them. My childhood was filled with countless hours of gaming across many platforms and genres, which sparked my passion for game development.

          <p class="story-description">
            I found that I naturally gravitated towards analyzing games‚Äîwhat made them fun, what design choices worked, and what could be improved. That's where the reviews come from, and I consider it to be a very important part of being a game dev. No one wants to play a boring game, right?
